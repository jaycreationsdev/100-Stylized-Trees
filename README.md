Technical Details

    A stylized bark material.
    A stylized foliage material that allows for complete customization.
    All trees have a vertex style wind material that allows for control of wind speed, wind strength, etc. (This material does not work based on vertex painting, meaning you can use this on ANY tree, not just the ones within this package.)

    6 Different realistic bark textures, each with their own stylized version.
    Different diffuse maps for the foliage of each type of tree.
